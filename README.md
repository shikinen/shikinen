## Hey there 👋

Senior Frontend Engineer based in **Warsaw, Poland**.

I build things with **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Vue**, I enjoy both React and Vue ecosystem. Currently crafting healthcare experiences at [Docplanner](https://github.com/docplanner).

When I'm not pushing pixels or arguing about state management, you'll probably find me exploring new tools or contributing to open source.
